            <h1>Pull Ups</h1>
            <div class = "vid1" style = "text-align: center; margin: auto;">

            <p>
                Pull-ups are a fundamental and challenging upper body exercise that primarily targets the muscles in your arms, back, and shoulders. They are considered one of the most effective bodyweight exercises for building upper body strength and muscular development.
                <br> <b>Pull-ups primarily target the following muscle groups:</b>

Latissimus Dorsi (Lats): The largest muscles in your back, located on the sides and middle of your back. Pull-ups heavily engage the lats, helping to develop width and thickness in this area.<br>

Biceps Brachii: The muscles located on the front of your upper arms. Pull-ups are an excellent exercise for targeting and strengthening the biceps.<br>

Rhomboids: Located between your shoulder blades, the rhomboids are responsible for pulling your shoulder blades together during the pull-up motion.<br>

Trapezius: A large muscle that spans the back of your neck and upper back. Pull-ups help develop the upper portion of the trapezius, contributing to a strong and well-defined upper back.<br>

Posterior Deltoids: Located in your shoulders, the posterior deltoids assist in the pulling motion during pull-ups.<br>

<b>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform a standard pull-up:</b><br>

1.Hang from a pull-up bar with an overhand grip (palms facing away from you), slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Alternatively, you can use an underhand grip (palms facing towards you) for a variation called chin-ups.<br>

2.Start with your arms fully extended, and your body hanging freely. Engage your core muscles to maintain stability throughout the exercise.<br>

3.Initiate the pull by squeezing your shoulder blades together and pulling your body upward, leading with your elbows. Aim to bring your chin above the bar.<br>

4.Pause briefly at the top of the movement, and then slowly lower yourself back to the starting position with control, fully extending your arms.<br>

Repeat the exercise for the desired number of repetitions.<br>

                     <p>
                        Skipping, also known as jump rope, is a popular cardiovascular exercise that involves jumping over a rope as it passes under your feet. It is a simple yet effective form of exercise that offers numerous health and fitness benefits. Skipping can be performed with a variety of techniques and variations, making it suitable for individuals of all fitness levels.<br>

                        <b>Here's a description of how to perform basic skipping:</b><br>
                        
                        1.Start by holding the handles of a jump rope, one in each hand, with your palms facing forward. Position the rope behind you, resting on the ground.<br>
                        
                        2.Stand with your feet together and your knees slightly bent. Maintain an upright posture with your shoulders relaxed.<br>
                        
                        3.Begin the skipping motion by swinging the rope over your head and in front of your body. As the rope comes towards your feet, jump slightly off the ground, just enough to allow the rope to pass underneath you.<br>
                        
                        4.As the rope reaches the ground, continue the jumping motion and repeat the process, aiming to jump over the rope with each rotation.<br>
                        
                        5.Start with a comfortable pace and gradually increase your speed as you become more proficient. You can also experiment with different techniques, such as alternating foot jumps, single leg jumps, or double unders (rotating the rope twice with each jump).<br>
                        
                        Maintain a steady rhythm and breathing pattern throughout the exercise. Focus on landing softly on the balls of your feet and using your wrists and forearms to rotate the rope.<br>

                        Running is a popular form of aerobic exercise that involves moving rapidly on foot, typically at a faster pace than walking. It is a versatile and accessible activity that can be performed outdoors or indoors on a treadmill. Running offers numerous physical, mental, and overall health benefits.<br>

<b>Here's a description of running and its benefits:</b><br>

1.Getting Started: To start running, find a suitable location such as a track, park, or neighborhood with safe and supportive surfaces. Wear comfortable running shoes and clothing that allows for freedom of movement. Begin with a warm-up consisting of light jogging or brisk walking to prepare your muscles and gradually increase your heart rate.<br>

2.Proper Form: Maintain an upright posture with your head facing forward and shoulders relaxed. Keep your arms bent at a 90-degree angle and swing them naturally back and forth. Land softly on the midfoot, rolling through to the toes, and push off the ground with each stride.<br>

3.Pace and Distance: Start with a comfortable pace and gradually increase your speed and distance over time. Listen to your body and adjust your running intensity to match your fitness level. Use a tracking device or smartphone app to monitor your distance, pace, and progress.<br>

4.Physical Benefits: Running is a highly effective cardiovascular exercise that improves heart and lung health. It strengthens the leg muscles, including the quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves. Regular running can enhance endurance, speed, and overall fitness level.<br>

5.Weight Management: Running is an excellent calorie-burning exercise that can aid in weight loss or weight maintenance. It helps to increase the metabolic rate and burn excess calories, contributing to a healthy body composition.<br>

6.Bone Health: Running is a weight-bearing exercise that helps build and maintain strong bones. Regular running can reduce the risk of osteoporosis and improve bone density, especially in weight-bearing bones like the hips and legs.<br>

7.Mental Well-being: Running has significant mental health benefits. It can reduce stress, anxiety, and symptoms of depression. Running releases endorphins, the body's natural feel-good hormones, promoting a positive mood and overall mental well-being.<br>

8.Social Opportunities: Running can be a solitary activity, providing time for introspection and self-reflection. It can also be a social activity, joining running groups or participating in organized races. Running with others can offer motivation, support, and a sense of community.<br>

9.Flexibility and Convenience: Running can be adapted to fit various schedules and lifestyles. It requires minimal equipment, and you can run almost anywhere, making it a flexible and convenient exercise option.<br>

                The Bench Press is a popular compound exercise that primarily targets the muscles of the chest (pectoralis major), shoulders (deltoids), and triceps. It is often performed with a barbell or dumbbells while lying on a flat bench. The Bench Press is an effective exercise for building upper body strength, muscle mass, and power.<br>

                <b>Here's a description of how to perform the Bench Press:</b><br>
                
               1. Setup: Lie flat on a bench with your feet firmly planted on the floor. Position yourself so that your eyes align with the barbell or dumbbells when they are racked. Your head, upper back, and glutes should be in contact with the bench.<br>
                
                2.Grip: Grasp the barbell with a grip slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Your palms should be facing forward, and your hands should be positioned directly above your elbows when the barbell is lowered to your chest. If using dumbbells, hold one in each hand with your palms facing forward.<br>
                
               3. Unrack the Weight: With a controlled motion, unrack the barbell or lift the dumbbells from the rack and hold them directly above your chest with your arms extended. Make sure your wrists are aligned with your forearms, and your elbows are not flaring out excessively.<br>
                
                4.Descent: Lower the barbell or dumbbells to your chest by bending your elbows. Aim to bring the weight to the middle or lower part of your chest while maintaining control and a full range of motion. Keep your elbows at around a 45-degree angle to your body.<br>
                
                5.Pause: Briefly pause at the bottom of the movement, with the weight just above your chest. This allows you to maintain control and engage the target muscles.<br>
                
                6.Press: Push the barbell or dumbbells back up to the starting position by extending your arms and engaging your chest, shoulders, and triceps. Focus on exerting force through your hands and driving the weight upward. Maintain control and avoid locking out your elbows at the top.<br>
                
                7.Breathing: Inhale as you lower the weight towards your chest, and exhale as you press it back up to the starting position.<br>
                
                8.Repetitions and Sets: Perform the desired number of repetitions and sets, resting between sets as needed. It is important to choose a weight that allows you to maintain proper form throughout the exercise.<br>

                     <p>
                        The Deadlift is a compound exercise that targets multiple muscle groups, including the lower back, glutes, hamstrings, and upper body. It is widely regarded as one of the most effective and functional exercises for developing overall strength and power. The Deadlift involves lifting a loaded barbell or other weighted object from the ground to a standing position while maintaining proper form and technique.<br>

<b>Here's a description of how to perform the conventional Deadlift, which is the most common variation:</b><br>

1.Approach the barbell with your feet hip-width apart, toes pointing forward. The barbell should be centered over the middle of your feet.<br>

2.Bend your knees and lower your hips, maintaining a neutral spine and a flat back. Grip the barbell with your hands just outside your knees, using either an overhand grip or a mixed grip (one hand overhand, one hand underhand).<br>

3.Take a deep breath, brace your core, and engage your lats (the muscles on the sides of your back). This will help stabilize your body throughout the lift.<br>

4.Begin the lift by driving through your heels, extending your hips and knees simultaneously. Keep the barbell close to your body as you lift, maintaining a straight bar path.<br>

5.As you stand up, focus on squeezing your glutes and maintaining a neutral spine. Avoid hyperextending your back or leaning too far backward.<br>

6.At the top of the lift, lock out your hips and knees, with your shoulders pulled back and down. Your body should be in a straight line from head to heels.<br>

7.To lower the barbell back to the ground, hinge at the hips and bend your knees while maintaining control. Keep the barbell close to your body during the descent.<br>

8.Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions, maintaining proper form and technique throughout.<br>
